  <p>
    <strong>Responsive design means</strong> that the design of a webpage adjusts in its layout, which 
    makes the content readable regardless the device. This implicates in other words that the user is 
    able to read the content on the same webpage from a smaller device such as a mobile phone or a larger 
    device such as a computer – without the require to scroll or zoom to achieve readability unlike 
    traditional web design. Considering the importance of a website being mobile friendly today, 
    responsive design is necessary for all sorts of devices in order to reach usability and 
    satisfaction for the user.
